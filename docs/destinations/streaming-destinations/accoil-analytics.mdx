## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending events to Accoil via the following <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</Link>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |


Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Accoil, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Accoil Analytics**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings 

To successfully set up Accoil as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

- **API Key**: Navigate to your Accoil dashboard and find your API Key under **General Account Settings**. Copy this API Key and paste it here.

## Identify

Identify calls recognize individual users and their attributes.

Example Call:
   ```javascript
   analytics.identify('userId123', {
     email: 'user@example.com',
     name: 'John Doe',
     createdAt: '2023-05-12T08:00:00Z'  // ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format
   });
   ```

## Group

Group calls link users to accounts and records account-level attributes.

Example Call:
   ```javascript
   analytics.group('accountId123', {
     name: 'Example Company',
     createdAt: '2021-03-15T09:00:00Z',  // ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format
     mrr: 3000,
     status: 'active'
   });
   ```

## Track

Track calls record specific user actions, like "Login" or "Purchase".

Use the "Noun_Verb" format to name your events, for example, `Report Created` or `Purchase Completed`.

Example Call:
   ```javascript
   analytics.track('Purchase Completed', {
     item: 'Book',
     price: 25.00
   });
   ```
  
## Page and screen

Page and Screen calls convert navigation calls into Track events to monitor user interactions within your product.

Example Calls:
   ```javascript
   analytics.page('Home Page');
   analytics.screen('Dashboard');
   ```

## Key Notes

- **Created At Date**: Ensure the `createdAt` field for users and accounts is in ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format for accurate tenure tracking.
- **Trait Handling**: Accoil stores traits sent with Identify and Group calls, but traits passed with Track calls are not stored. Only event names and counts are recorded.
- **Event Aggregation**: Accoil simplifies event tracking by aggregating daily event counts.
- **Page and Screen Calls**: These calls are automatically converted into Track events for easier monitoring of user navigation.
