## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending events to Accoil via the following <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</Link>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |


Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Accoil, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Accoil Analytics**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings 

To successfully set up Accoil as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

- **API Key**: Navigate to your Accoil dashboard and find your API Key under **General Account Settings**. Copy this API Key and paste it here.

## Identify

Identify calls recognize individual users and their attributes.

Example Call:
   ```javascript
   analytics.identify('userId123', {
     email: 'user@example.com',
     name: 'John Doe',
     createdAt: '2023-05-12T08:00:00Z'  // ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format
   });
   ```

### Supported mappings

| **RudderStack property** | **Accoil property** | **Note** |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :------- |
| `userId` <br/> `traits.userId` <br/> `traits.id` <br/> `context.traits.userId` <br/> `context.traits.id` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | tracking_id | |
| `traits` <br/> `context.traits` | Passed through as is to Accoil | See traits mapping for details |
| `timestamp` <br/> `originalTimestamp` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | timestamp           | ISO 8601 format datetime or unix timestamp |

#### Traits mapping

| **RudderStack trait** | **Note** |
| :-------------------- | :------- |
| `email` | Email addresses are highly recommended as they are often used to identify users across multiple platforms. (Highly Recommended) |
| `name` | Providing a name helps display users in Accoil. If no name is provided, the email address is displayed instead. (Highly Recommended) |
| `role` | Describes the userâ€™s role in your product such as Admin, Owner, Team Member. (Suggested) |
| `accountStatus` | Capturing the account status on the user can be helpful to segment users. Possible options include: Free, Trial, Paid, Cancelled. (Suggested) |
| `createdAt` | When was the user created, including this ensures that tenure tracking is accurate. (Highly Recommended) |

## Group

Group calls link users to accounts and records account-level attributes.

Example Call:
   ```javascript
   analytics.group('accountId123', {
     name: 'Example Company',
     createdAt: '2021-03-15T09:00:00Z',  // ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format
     mrr: 3000,
     status: 'active'
   });
   ```

### Supported mappings

| **RudderStack property** | **Accoil property** | **Note** |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :------- |
| `userId` <br/> `traits.userId` <br/> `traits.id` <br/> `context.traits.userId` <br/> `context.traits.id` <br/> | tracking_id | |
| `groupId` <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | tracking_id | |
| `traits` <br/> `context.traits` | Passed through as is to Accoil | See traits mapping for details |
| `timestamp` <br/> `originalTimestamp` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | timestamp           | ISO 8601 format datetime or unix timestamp |

#### Traits mapping

| **RudderStack trait** | **Note** |
| :-------------------- | :------- |
| `name` | The name of the account. Without providing a name, accounts are displayed using a numeric ID, making them harder to identify. (Highly Recommended) |
| `createdAt` | Helps calculate account tenure. If no createdAt is provided, the earliest createdAt from the associated users will be used. (Highly Recommended) |
| `status` | The overall status of your the account subscription. Possible options include: Free, Trial, Paid, Cancelled (Highly Recommended) |
| `plan` | The plan type helps in segmenting accounts by their subscription tier (e.g., starter, pro, enterprise). (Recommended) |
| `mrr` | Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is important for segmenting accounts by value. It also allows Accoil to show the dollar value of different segments. Ideally this is passed in cents eg $99 becomes 9900. (Highly Recommended) |

## Track

Track calls record specific user actions, like "Login" or "Purchase".

Use the "Noun_Verb" format to name your events, for example, `Report Created` or `Purchase Completed`.

Example Call:
   ```javascript
   analytics.track('Purchase Completed', {
     item: 'Book',
     price: 25.00
   });
   ```

### Supported mappings

| **RudderStack property** | **Accoil property** | **Note** |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :------- |
| `userId` <br/> `traits.userId` <br/> `traits.id` <br/> `context.traits.userId` <br/> `context.traits.id` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | tracking_id | |
| `event` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | Event name | |
| `timestamp` <br/> `originalTimestamp` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | timestamp           | ISO 8601 format datetime or unix timestamp |
  
## Page and screen

Page and Screen calls convert navigation calls into Track events to monitor user interactions within your product.

Example Calls:
   ```javascript
   analytics.page('Home Page');
   analytics.screen('Dashboard');
   ```

### Supported mappings

| **RudderStack property** | **Accoil property** | **Note** |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :------- |
| `userId` <br/> `traits.userId` <br/> `traits.id` <br/> `context.traits.userId` <br/> `context.traits.id` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | tracking_id | |
| `name` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | Page or screen name | |
| `timestamp` <br/> `originalTimestamp` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | timestamp           | ISO 8601 format datetime or unix timestamp |

## Key Notes

- **Created At Date**: Ensure the `createdAt` field for users and accounts is in ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp format for accurate tenure tracking.
- **Trait Handling**: Accoil stores traits sent with Identify and Group calls, but traits passed with Track calls are not stored. Only event names and counts are recorded.
- **Event Aggregation**: Accoil simplifies event tracking by aggregating daily event counts.
- **Page and Screen Calls**: These calls are automatically converted into Track events for easier monitoring of user navigation.
